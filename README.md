# Defyre Utility Token (DFUT)

The Defyre Project is a revolutionary initiative focused on providing on-chain security and risk data for ERC20 tokens, allowing users, developers, operators, Exchanges and Automated Market Makers (AMM) to assess the risk of tokens they own, or in the case of Exchanges/DEX/AMMs, preventing malicious actors from publishing tokens on their platforms. 

The architecture is based on traditional oracles networks, but rather than collecting and pushing price information to the blockchain, it focuses entirely on security data points which include security audit information, smart contract verification, risk scores, and many more.

This repository includes the Solidity code for the Defyre Utility Token (DFUT)
